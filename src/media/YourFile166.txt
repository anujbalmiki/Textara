Whales breathe air just as human beings do.But they do not breathe through their mouths as wecan. All of their breathing is through two little nostrilsplaced on top of their heads. When the whale sinksunder the water, special muscles shut his nose to keepout water. This makes it possible for him to swimwith his mouth open. He can capture prey and eveneat under water without danger of drowning. A whale canhold his breath and remain under water for an hourwithout any difficulty. As he rises to the surface, heblows the hot air from his lungs with tremendous force.People used to think this fountain of steam was water.
